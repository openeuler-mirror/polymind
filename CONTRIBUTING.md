# Contributing to DeepChat

We love your input! We want to make contributing to DeepChat as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Internal Team Contributors

#### Bug Fixes and Minor Feature Improvements

- Develop directly on the `dev` branch
- Code submitted to the `dev` branch must ensure:
  - Basic functionality works
  - No compilation errors
  - Project can start normally with `pnpm run dev`

#### Major Features or Refactoring

- Create a new feature branch named `feature/featurename`
- Merge the feature branch back to `dev` branch upon completion
